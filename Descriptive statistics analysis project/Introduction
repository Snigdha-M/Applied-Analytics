The primary goal of this analysis is to answer specific problem statements related to the relationships
between glucose, bloodpressure, BMI, insulin, age, diabetic predigree function and skin thickness levels,
diabetes outcome, and the number of pregnancies. Through various statistical techniques, we aim to uncover
patterns and significant predictors of diabetes within this dataset.
